## Usage Guide

### Creating Your First Learning Module

1. **Add a Topic**: Click "Add Topic" to create your first main topic
2. **Add Study Materials**: Select a topic and add PDFs, text, or links in the left panel
3. **Create Visualizations**: Add interactive HTML/CSS/JavaScript visualizations in the right panel
4. **Save Your Work**: Use the "Save" button to export your learning module

### Using Math Formulas

The platform supports LaTeX math formulas in text content:

**Inline Math** (within text):
```
The kinetic energy formula is $KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ where m is mass.
```

**Block Math** (centered, standalone):
```
$$E = mc^2$$
$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}$$
```

**Common Examples**:
- Fractions: `$\frac{1}{2}$`, `$\frac{a}{b}$`
- Superscripts: `$x^2$`, `$e^{-x}$`
- Subscripts: `$H_2O$`, `$x_1$`
- Greek letters: `$\alpha$`, `$\beta$`, `$\pi$`
- Integrals: `$\int$`, `$\sum$`
- Square roots: `$\sqrt{x}$`, `$\sqrt[3]{x}$`
